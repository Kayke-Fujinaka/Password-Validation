<h1 align="center">🔑 PASSWORD VALIDATOR</h1>

> 🔎 It's a password validator made with JavaScript

## ⚔️ Challenge

In this challenge, you must build a method/function that must be able to receive a password and return if it is valid, given some validations. Use the Typescript programming language.

- It must be possible to receive a string that will pass through the following validations:
    - The password must contain from 16 to 32 characters;
    - Must contain at least 2 special characters;
    - Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters;
    - It cannot contain more than 3 sequences of characters, letters or numbers (abc or 123, for example).
- Must return an object containing the result (true or false), and a list of validation errors in which the password did not pass;
- Must contain unit tests to validate the cases listed in the example.
- Use OOP (Study Hard or Try)
- Use Typescript.
- Do unit tests.
